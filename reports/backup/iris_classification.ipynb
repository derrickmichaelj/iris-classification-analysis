    "The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, divided evenly into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica (50 samples each). Each observation contains four continuous morphological measurements: `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, and `petal_width`. All four features are recorded in centimetres. The dataset is well structured, with no missing values, and includes a balanced class distribution across the three species. A preliminary summary of the numerical features shows that values vary substantially between species; for example, setosa flowers tend to have smaller petal lengths (around 1.4 cm), while virginica flowers exhibit much larger petal dimensions. These clear differences suggest that the dataset is suitable for classification tasks, making it an ideal test case for evaluating machine learning models. In this project, we have developed a classification model using **Logistic Regression** to predict Iris flower species. based on four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A baseline **DummyClassifier** produced an accuracy of approximately `0.33` across cross-validation folds, confirming that the data is not trivially predictable and that a more sophisticated model is required. Before training the model, all numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler, ensuring that differences in measurement units did not disproportionately influence the classifier. After scaling features and performing hyperparameter tuning weith randomized search, our final **Logistic Regression classifier** achieved strong performance, with a training accuracy of `0.983` and a test accuracy of `0.90`. The confusion matrix indicates that the most predicitons were correct, with only a small number of misclassifications occuring between the **versicolor** and **virginica** classes reflectiong their natural feature similarity. Overall, the model demostrated high predicive performance on unseen data, though further refinement or more advnaced model could help reduce raiming classification overlap. "

    "A thorough understanding of the geographic distribution and traits of plants is invaluable to the development of sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation (Joly et al., 2014). Thus, as the demand for information and need for biodiversity grow, it becomes even more important that this task is one that can be performed efficiently and accurately (Thyagharajan & Kiruba Raji, 2018). One promising method through which this could be accomplished is machine learning classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore how different physical measurements of iris flowers relate to species identity and to build a classification model that can accurately predict species based on these characteristics. The Iris dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning because it is clean, balanced, and contains clear biological differences among species. Each flower is described by four continuous measurements—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—and belongs to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these measurements reflect real morphological differences, the dataset provides a natural opportunity to study the relationship between flower structure and species classification. It also allows us to evaluate and compare machine learning models in a controlled environment. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and correlations, then develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression. We also include a DummyClassifier as a baseline to ensure that model performance improvements are meaningful rather than accidental.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we evaluate the model using cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and confusion-matrix diagnostics. This approach allows us to understand both how well the model learns from the training data and how reliably it generalizes to unseen samples. Overall, this project demonstrates the connection between biological measurements and species identity while providing a clear example of building, tuning, and interpreting a supervised classification model."

    "The dataset used in this project is the classic Iris flower dataset originally collected by the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 as part of his research on linear discriminant analysis. It is publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where it is widely used as a benchmark dataset for classification tasks. Each row in the dataset represents physical measurements of a single iris flower, including four numerical attributes sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width recorded in centimetres. Alongside these measurements, each observation is labelled with one of three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica), originally identified by botanists through morphological characteristics. This dataset is clean, balanced, and well-suited for evaluating machine learning classification algorithms.\n",

Additionally, our correlation matrix shows that sepal attributes are indeed correlated with petal attributes, increasing their utility to our model. After finding no conclusive evidence in support of dropping features from our model, we move forward with the full set of features from the dataset."

    "Achieving a training score of 0.98, it is evident that the model was able to learn the relationships between the four iris measurements. Additionally, the model generalizes to the unseen data quite well, yielding a test score of 0.9. While the discrepancy between the model's train and test scores elicit some concern around potential overfitting in the model, it is not large enough to overshadow its strong generalization capabilities.\n",

    "These findings imply that the four measured flower characteristics are strong predictors that could reliably enhance species identification. Future questions could explore whether more complex models could grow accuracy even further or whether certain species pairs remain more difficult to separate due to particular traits. Overall, it appears that this model is well on its way to becoming a strong tool for iris identification."
